## Algorithm
- This is a Hamiltonian Path problem. More info see here:
- http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianPath.html
## What does my code do
- The file 'Find_supertring.py' allows you to assemble the sequencing reads to superstring.
- It first add the reads to a graph, then based on the overlaps between reads, the edges are added.
- The superstring are traversed along the edge.
